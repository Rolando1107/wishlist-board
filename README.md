# wishlist-board

## Description
We created this Application that allows the user to list their wishes and have some options to choose from.
How motivation was to make an application that is user friendly and has all the features that a user would want and also making working easier with the a few categories to choose from as an idea.
We live in a world where almost everyone is relying on technology for daily activities, a wish list is something that everyone has, and helping the user with a tool to achieve this other than the traditional pen and paper is our reason behind this idea.
This application helps the user not only to explore their wishes while listing them but also to give the user the flexibility to scroll different categories that we would think that they would be interested in and also seeing some images of the same.
By building this application we have maximized all the skills that we have learnt in class, practicing working as a team and above all sharpening our knowledge on Github.
